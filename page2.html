Our drive-team adapted quickly and efficiently to act as a defense bot, and our dedicated pit crew worked to fix these issues throughout our competition. Our robot came out of the tournament much better than it came in. Throughout our pool play games our improvement was clear and was amazing to see. At the end of the pool play the top teams chose their alliances, which are created by teams in the top 8 seats selecting two other teams to be together on a team. Crevolution was selected by team 7769 and 6120, to make up the 8th seat alliance. We were defeated by the 1st seat team, which later won the competition.  </div>
